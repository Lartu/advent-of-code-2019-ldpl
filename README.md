# Advent of Code 2019 - LDPL

This repo contains my solutions for [Advent of Code 2019](https://adventofcode.com/2019) written in
[LDPL](https://github.com/Lartu/ldpl). Don't expect nice code here before or up to day 2. Day 3 onwards
is a little cleaner.

Programmed for **LDPL 4.4**, won't
work in previous versions of the language.
